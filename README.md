Simple Life Manager Software

This is a simple project to demonstrate my knowlodge in developing software. Feel free to use it as you want.
It uses Clean Architecture approach as it has been presented by Jason Tylor:
https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture

It also uses CQRS pattern.
Tests are divided into 3 categories : Unit,Integration and acceptance.
The Acceptance tests project uses a CustomWebApplicationFactory to replace SQL Server with SqLite for the tests.
